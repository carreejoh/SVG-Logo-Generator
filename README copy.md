# Description 
 This node application generates a simple svg logo based on four criteria submitted through the npm "inqurier" module. The first question ask for a word (up to three letters long), the second quesitons asks for the color of said text, the third gives three options between a square, triangle and circle, and the final quesitons is on the shapes color. This data is then routed through a function that creates said logo. The shapes are defined in their own unique classes, and the generator alters that data.

 Tests to insure a default color is always selected, tests to insure all colors are compatible, tests to ensure no more than 3 characters can be entered, and test to insure an svg file is created. A test.js file has been created to test that the generator returns an svg file, but is currently not functioning correctly.
